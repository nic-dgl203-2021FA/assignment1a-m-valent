          <h1>Misko Valent</h1>
          <h2>Digital Media Designer</h2>

          <p>
            In the Spring of 2019 I started my journey toward an Advanced Design
            and Development Diploma at North Island College. Currently in my
            last year and am excited to present my accomplishments thus far.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is my desire to find employment, furthering my skills while
            providing team support and great contributions from my wealth of
            design inspirations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have many transferable skills from numerous experiences, all have
            customer service and dealing with people at its core. I work well in
            teams or on my own, proven problem solver, proactive minded,
            initiative taking, friendly demeanour; someone that goes above and
            beyond for the employer and their clients.

            <h3>"Action Not Words"</h3>
            <p>
              Using Adobe Illustrator, this was my very first project, zero
              knowledge prior to starting this. We were asked to create a poster
              based on a mock customer with following guidelines:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>All in it together...</li>
              <li>Environmental conscious...</li>
              <li>Rebuilding the future...</li>
              <li>Three colours max...</li>
            </ul>

            <button

            <h3>"Fantastic Voyage"</h3>
            <p>
              This time using Adobe Photoshop, we were tasked to create a
              collage of at least five different images. I must admit I really
              enjoyed all the options and tools at my disposal. Our guidelines
              for this project were:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Non Destructive with original images...</li>
              <li>Seperate layer for each ajustment...</li>
              <li>Croping, masking, & bending...</li>
              <li>Full page had to be used...</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>"DJ Galaxy Magazine Cover"</h3>
            <p>
              In this class we focused on Typography, how to correctly use it,
              to appreciate its design; avoiding bad fonts and families. This
              project we were to design a magazine cover. We were tasked with
              these guidelines:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Full page cover image...</li>
              <li>Title, tagline, and supporting images...</li>
              <li>Three feature articles minimum...</li>
              <li>Three font-families max...</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>"Grub Hunter Mobile App / Commercial"</h3>
            <p>
              In my second year, I combined two class projects into one. Using
              Adobe XD we were to design a proto type mobile app. I choose to
              build an App that would help locate travelling food trucks. In my
              audio & video class we were tasked to create a video. My idea was
              to make a short commercial for the food truck App I was working
              on. I was very happy with the results, many technics went into the
              final product.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some of the programs & applications used in the production were:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop...</li>
              <li>Adobe InDesign & XD...</li>
              <li>Adobe Lightroom Classic...</li>
              <li>Adobe Premiere Pro, Audition, & After Effects...</li>
            </ul>
